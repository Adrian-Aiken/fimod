# fimod
factory idle mod

this is a userscript that adds some tweaks to [Factory Idle]

works on both the [Factory Idle] site and [Kongregate]

## installation

1. install a userscript manager
  - [Greasemonkey] - Firefox
  - [Tampermonkey] - Chrome
1. install the script from github
  - [fimod.user.js](http://github.com/sidke/fimod/raw/master/dist/fimod.user.js)

## configuration

you can toggle each individual setting on fimod's options page in the game

##### improved map navigation
improves dragging, enables map zooming, and allows keyboard movement. use the mouse wheel for zooming, and arrow/wasd keys for keyboard. also fixes the firefox mouse dragging issue

##### fullscreen mode
restyles page content to fit the map in the rest of the remaining space while retaining ads for non-premium users. does not expand the map on kongregate

##### move overview
moves the overview from the top left into the left panel, and stretches the top bar to the full width. this fixes issues with cramped space when playing on kongregate

##### toggle background mode
prevents the game from automatically entering background mode, and provides a button to manually turn background mode on
